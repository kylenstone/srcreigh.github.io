title: Hacking the Hackathon Movement---Three Challenges
date: 2014-09-11
preamble: >
   The intended audience of this post is the hackathon community at large, but this paragraph is about those who aren&rsquo;t. If that&rsquo;s you, then you need to know that we would love to have you join us, and that it&rsquo;s very easy to start taking part! Although we talk about techy stuff a lot right now,hackathons are ultimately about building things that we can get excited about and that are useful in the world around us. This clearly doesn&rsquo;t have to be a website or an app&mdash;so if you are passionate or want to make the world a better place, head on over to <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers">the Hackathon Hackers facebook group</a> and introduce yourself!

The hackathon community has seen hundreds of hackathons. We&rsquo;re going
see tens more [just this Fall](http://mlh.io/seasons/f2014/events), with up to
three occurring almost every weekend until Christmas. In total, there have been
*thousands* of projects produced at our events. Although there has and will
continue to be hacks that blow minds, I want to present three hackathon
challenges that are meant to provide the inspiration required to take the
hackathon community to the next level.  

There is only one theme and motivation for these challenges: we need to *hack
the hackathon community*. Some of the most passionate North American hackers are
getting together *every weekend* all over the continent. This is the first
time that such a diverse, motivated, talented, and inclusive group of people
have been able to meet up *in person* at such scale and frequency. It&rsquo;s
absolutely unprecedented. The amount of potential we have as a community is
further supported by how closely the rest of the world is watching us.

Most North American tech companies want to have their fingers in the
talent that we have in our community. They collectively invest *hundreds of
thousands of dollars per year* to have a presence at the hackathon events that
we organize. We are in the press weekly. The colleges, universities, and high
schools we attend let us *absolutely trash* a bunch of their buildings while we
work for 24&ndash;36 hours straight to build our hacks. The world is watching
us. These hacking challenges are meant to inspire you to explore what we
can become as a community.

## 1. Hacking Collaboration
We have diverse talent at large scale, but hackathon events generally limit 
us to competing in teams of 4 or less with projects that last 24&ndash;36 
hours. So, how can we more effectively work together? Here are some ideas:

### 1.1 Mass Collaboration
Everybody has thought of this at one point or another. What if, instead of
competing in teams of 4, we worked together as one team of 1000 or 5 teams
of 200? What could we accomplish? This doesnt&rsquo;t have to be a tech
hack; it could be a project management hack. Keep in mind that one of our
strengths as a community is that we can meet *in person*; if you can utilize
this, even better.

* Crowd-sourced data classficiation for data hacks
* Realtime, collaborative mentoring (make it easy to discover local mentors!) 

### 1.2 Communication
Many of us feel that the Hackathon community is outgrowing Facebook as a
platform for discussion. However, Facebook is the platform that has caused us
so much growth in the first place: ease of joining, the fact that Hackathon
Hackers posts overflow into friend&rsquo;s newsfeeds, etc. With that in mind,
here are some ideas:

* Facebook add-ons (browser plugins, robot mods, etc) that reduce visibility 
  of bad comments, keep flamewars at bay, help people remember to be really 
  nice, etc.
* Alternate discussion platforms that provide super-easy Facebook signup, and
  reposting to Facebook (think Rdio, 8tracks, Spotify&mdash;but HH)

## 2. Hacking Culture
The culture of the Hackathon community is good, and it&rsquo;s getting better
every week. However, there are always ways to improve in this regard:

* Think Humans of New York, except for Hackathon attendees and cases of
  mentorship and friend building. Even though [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io)
  is working on this, you should still try! Good feelings are not a zero sum game.
* Solidarity in general. We represent inclusivity and diversity&mdash;gender,
  race, nationality, age, social class, sexual orientation, anything. Anything
  that brings us all together and make any minorities feel welcomed and
  encouraged is great.
* Friendships. Make a Tinder-for-github. Think of real-life events or games
  that hackers can use to socialize even more. Start some inter-college banter
  with cheers.

## 3. Hacking Outreach &amp; Growth
I have had one-on-one conversations with friends of mine about how they can
join the hackathon community. Although I will continue to do this, ideally it
will be *abundantly clear* to anyone who&rsquo;s ever *heard* of a hackathon
that they are welcomed and encouraged to go and try it out. Like when my mom
started telling me about Uber and AirBNB, I would *love* to start hearing of
random people I know independently going to hackathons without my intervention.

* Hackathon pariticipant social media campaigns. &ldquo;I built X at Y. 
  \#JoinAHackathon&rdquo;.
* Impromptu hackathon organizing apps: If I want to have a hackathon in the
  next hour for the rest of the night, I should be able to click a few buttons
  to organize this and automatically invite hackers in the area. (Shoutout to 
  the guy who made an iOS app that does this at PennApps X; we just need to 
  scale it up and go cross-platform!)
* Frameworks for hackathons: template registration websites, template native
  event apps, etc.
