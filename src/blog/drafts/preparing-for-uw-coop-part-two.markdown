preamble: This is the second post of several that I am writing to help incoming University of Waterloo Computer Science of Software Engineering students prepare for the competitive co-op program at Waterloo. I am writing it with the help of many friends of mine; this is a group endeavour. You can read the first post <a href="/blog/posts/preparing-for-uw-coop-part-one/">here</a>.

The co-op program at the University of Waterloo provides many incredible opportunities for Computer Science and Software Engineering students: 2 years of work experience by the time one graduates, networking for getting a job after graduating, the chance to apply things one learns in courses immediately, and more. However, it is a competitive program. So, to help incoming students prepare for co-op, I am writing a series of blog posts; this is the second post of several. The [first post] was about operating systems, development environments, and other tools. This post is about learning: online courses and tutorials, research, and more.

## Research

The kind of research I spoke about before I sometimes call *microresearch*. This is when you use Google to figure out a specific error that you get from a compiler, or when you&rsquo;re trying to solve an issue with some device driver on Ubuntu, or when you forget what the command is to search for text in files (that&rsquo;s `grep`, by the way). These are (usually) small, easily resolved things that come up unexpectedly 20+ times in per day.

It was said last time that it&rsquo;s important to know of as many different tools and ideas as you can. This is important, because when you know of a lot of different things, you often know what to learn about when you encounter problems you don&rsquo;t know how to solve. The content of this post focuses on the actionable part of this idea idea: how to learn things. 

### Types of Learning 

In my mind, actual research falls under two categories. The first category is structured learning. This such as a course, guide, or tutorial, and self-directed learning, such as looking through documentation, reading sample code, trying and failing, and in general building an understanding of some topic bit-by-bit, in the order that you see fit.
