preamble: This is the second post of several that I am writing to help incoming University of Waterloo Computer Science of Software Engineering students prepare for the competitive co-op program at Waterloo. I am writing it with the help of many friends of mine; this is a group endeavour. You can read the first post <a href="/blog/posts/preparing-for-uw-coop-part-one/">here</a>.

The co-op program at the University of Waterloo provides many incredible opportunities for Computer Science and Software Engineering students: 2 years of work experience by the time one graduates, networking for getting a job after graduating, the chance to apply things one learns in courses immediately, and more. However, it is a competitive program. So, to help incoming students prepare for co-op, I am writing a series of blog posts; this is the second post of several. The [first post] was about operating systems, development environments, and other tools. This post is about learning: online courses and tutorials, research, and more.

## Research

The kind of research I spoke about before I sometimes call *microresearch*. This is when you use Google to figure out a specific error that you get from a compiler, or when you&rsquo;re trying to solve an issue with some device driver on Ubuntu, or when you forget what the command is to search for text in files (that&rsquo;s `grep`, by the way). These are  small, easily resolved things that come up unexpectedly many times in per day.

It was said last time that it&rsquo;s important to know of as many different tools and ideas as you can. THis is important because when you know of a lot of different things, you often know what to learn about when you encounter problems you don&rsquo;t know how to solve. The content of this post focuses on the actionable part of this idea: how to learn things.

I&rsquo;ve split up learning into two categories. The first is structured learning, such as courses, tutorials, or guides, and the second is unstructured learning, which is self-directed research; this usually involves figuring things out bit by bit as you encounter a need for them. I&rsquo;ll talk about them both individually first.

### Structured Learning

Some of you might be taking an online course or two already this summer, whether it be on Udacity, Coursera, or another platform. Others might have read a book about a programming language, or about how to make mobile apps, or about some other things. All of these resources are structured learning: instructors (or authors) will tell you some facts, and maybe ask you to do some things, and then do it again. It will be them that decides what you will be told next, and it will be them that decides, in total, what you will have learned and done if you complete every lesson and every exercise in the material. In a sense, these blog posts are structured learning.

Structured learning is a great tool to get you started in a subject. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t know enough about a subject to start somewhere and add little pieces of knowledge until you know everything about it; this is when structured learning shines. You will be guided right from the start, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting started.

One important thing that structured thing gives you is a way to evaluate yourself. For me, not being able to tell that I&rsquo;m doing a good job is a huge barrier to getting started with something. How can I know that the website I built is good? How do I know that the code I wrote is good code? A course on web application development will teach you the basics of password management, like how you shouldn&rsquo;t store them in plain text, how to use one-way hashing functions, etc; if your website has passwords, this is one way you will learn to evaluate your website. A beginner programming course might start to teach you how to reason about how fast some code will run, for example; this is one way to evaluate how good some code is. 

A certain danger when doing structured learning is not applying the knowledge you gain, and then losing it. Sometimes it isn&rsquo;t clear, though, how you&rsquo;re supposed to apply the knowledge in the course; this is why courses that tell you what to do with your knowledge are sometimes better than courses that don&rsquo;t give you any exercises.

The other form of learning, unstructured or self-directed learning, is good because you usually do it for the express purpose of trying to do something you don&rsquo;t know how to do; this means that you usually apply the knowledge immediately, and hence have a better chance of grasping it immediately.

### Unstructured Learning
