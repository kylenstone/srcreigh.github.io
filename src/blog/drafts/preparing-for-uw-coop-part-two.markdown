preamble: This is the second post of several that I am writing to help incoming University of Waterloo Computer Science of Software Engineering students prepare for the competitive co-op program at Waterloo. I am writing it with the help of many friends of mine; this is a group endeavour. You can read the first post <a href="/blog/posts/preparing-for-uw-coop-part-one/">here</a>.

The co-op program at the University of Waterloo provides many incredible opportunities for Computer Science and Software Engineering students: 2 years of work experience by the time one graduates, networking for getting a job after graduating, the chance to apply things one learns in courses immediately, and more. However, it is a competitive program. So, to help incoming students prepare for co-op, I am writing a series of blog posts; this is the second post of several. The [first post] was about operating systems, development environments, and other tools. This post is about learning: online courses and tutorials, research, and more.

## Research

The kind of research I spoke about before I sometimes call *microresearch*. This is when you use Google to figure out a specific error that you get from a compiler, or when you&rsquo;re trying to solve an issue with some device driver on Ubuntu, or when you forget what the command is to search for text in files (that&rsquo;s `grep`, by the way). These are  small, easily resolved things that come up unexpectedly many times in per day.

It was said last time that, although knowing how to use every single tool is usually impossible, it&rsquo;s important to know *of* as many different tools and ideas as you can. This is because when you know of a lot of different things, you often know what to learn about when you encounter problems you don&rsquo;t know how to solve. The content of this post focuses on the actionable part of this idea: how to learn things.
First, we&rsquo;ll talk about learning in general. After that, you will see the result of all of my friends&rsquo; take on what good resources for learning are: good online courses, good topics to study on your own, etc. Finally, where learning sits in the big picture of preparing for co-op 

In general, I like to think about learning being of two categories. The first is structured learning. This includes things such as courses, tutorials, or guides. The second is unstructured learning, which is different from courses because your research is usually self-directed. It usually involves figuring things out bit by bit as you encounter a need for them.

### Structured Learning

Some of you might be taking an online course or two already this summer, whether it be on Udacity, Coursera, or another platform. Others might have read a book about a programming language, or about how to make mobile apps, or about some other thing. Usually, one will take a course about a topic if theyAll of these resources are structured learning: instructors (or authors) will tell you some facts, and maybe ask you to do some things, and then repeat this process for the next lesson. It will be them that decides what you will be told next, and it will be them that decides, in total, what you will have learned and done if you complete every lesson and every exercise in the material. In a sense, these blog posts are structured learning.

Structured learning is a great tool to get you started in a subject. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t know enough about a subject to start somewhere and add little pieces of knowledge until you know everything about it; this is when structured learning shines. You will be guided right from the start, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting started.

One important thing that structured thing gives you is a way to evaluate yourself. For me, not being able to tell that I&rsquo;m doing a good job is a huge barrier to getting started with something. How can I know that the website I built is good? How do I know that the code I wrote is good code? A course on web application development will teach you the basics of password management, like how you shouldn&rsquo;t store them in plain text, how to use one-way hashing functions, etc; if your website has passwords, this is one way you will learn to evaluate your website. A beginner programming course might start to teach you how to reason about how fast some code will run, for example; this is one way to evaluate how good some code is. 

A certain danger when doing structured learning is not applying the knowledge you gain, and then losing it. Sometimes it isn&rsquo;t clear, though, how you&rsquo;re supposed to apply the knowledge in the course; this is why courses that tell you what to do with your knowledge are sometimes better than courses that don&rsquo;t give you any exercises. In fact, one of the benefits of the other kind of learning&mdash;unstructured learning&mdash;is that you usually don&rsquo;t have to search for applications!

### Unstructured Learning

Unstructured learning is when you decide to forge your own path to learn about a topic. Although you might incorporate bits from a tutorial here or a chapter from some course as resources in your research, the difference is that it is ultimately you that will decide what to research next.

This method of learning often isn&rsquo;t suitable for beginners. When starting out with an entirely new subject, there are often barriers to progressing. Intimidation is a real thing. It can be hard to believe that something is possible to learn before it&rsquo;s broken down into small pieces; the final target might make 0 sense until you learn preliminary things.
