title: Hacking the Hackathon Movement: Three Challenges
date: 2014-09-11
preamble: >
   The intended audience of this post is the hackathon community at large, but this paragraph is about those
who aren&rsquo;t. If that&rsquo;s you, then you need to know that we would love to have you join us, and
that it&rsquo;s very easy to start taking part! Although we talk about techy stuff a lot right now,
hackathons are ultimately about building things that we can get excited about and that are useful in the
world around us. This clearly doesn&rsquo;t have to be a website or an app&mdash;so if you are passionate or 
want to make the world a better place, head on over to 
<a href="https://facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers">the Hackathon Hackers facebook group</a> and 
introduce yourself!

We as a hackathon community have seen hundreds of hackathons. We&rsquo;re going see tens more 
[just this Fall](http://mlh.io/seasons/f2014/events), with up to three occurring every weekend until
 Christmas. In total, there have been *thousands* of projects produced at our events. Although there has 
and will continue to be hacks that blow minds, I want to present three hackathon challenges that are meant
 to provide the inspiration required to take the hackathon community to the next level.

There is one only theme and motivation for these challenges: we need to *hack the hackathon movement*. Some
 of the most passionate North American hackers are getting together *every weekend* all over the continent.
 This is the first time that such a diverse, motivated, talented, and inclusive group of people have been
 able to meet up *in person* at such scale and frequency. It&rsquo;s absolutely unprecedented. The amount of
 potential we have as a community is further evidenced by how closely the rest of the world is watching us.

Most every North American tech company wants to have their fingers in the talent that we have in our 
community. They collectively invest *hundrds of thousands of dollars per year* to have a presence at the
hackathon events that we organize. We are in the press weekly. The colleges, universities, and high schools 
we attend let us *absolutely trash* a bunch of their buildings while we work for 24&ndash;36 hours straight 
to build our hacks. Why is the world watching us so closely? That is *precisely* the question these 
challenges are meant to explore.
