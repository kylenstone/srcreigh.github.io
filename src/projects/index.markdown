[Gestice](http://gestice.org) is a fun and secure way to unlock your phone and
automatically launch your favourite apps using the 
[Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com). It lets you use three 
different shaking gestures to unlock your phone and launch any three apps. What
makes it *secure* is that the gestures have to sync with the Pebble watch and
your phone&mdash;in other words, it has to be you that shakes your phone to 
unlock it!



## Lockr

Developed at HackMIT 2014, Lockr is an Android application that helps keep
your phone secure when you need it to be. After setting it up with places where
your phone is safe to leave unlocked, it will put a PIN on your phone only when
you've left your safe areas. You can use this to automatically unlock your 
phone when you get in from a day out, but also automatically keep it secure 
when you leave the next day.

A proof-of-concept working application was shown at the hackathon and hasn't
been worked on since.
