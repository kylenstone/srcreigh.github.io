I study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about
and have experience with software development and architecture, and I'm
currently exploring how that experience can interest my other passions: people,
communities, language, communication, and product design.

school&rsquo;s website.

## Projects
1. Growing entrepreneurial discussion communities in Waterloo;

This website is built with a lot of cool new technology:
[jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org), and in particular
[Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io). One of the most exciting part of building
this website was learning these technologies and contributing to Metalsmith and
its plugin ecosystem.
