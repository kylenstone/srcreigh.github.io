I am studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and I have a 
passion for making things. I have extensive mobile development 
experience on Android and iOS from an 8-month internship at 
[Relay](http://relay.im) and hackathon projects such as 
[Gestice](http://gestice.org). 

I'm currently interested in the
Go programming language, PhoneGap mobile applications, and learning
how to go to sleep instead of reading Hacker News on my phone while
lying in bed.

This website is built with a lot of cool new technology: 
[jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org), and in particular 
[Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io). One of the most exciting part of building 
this website was learning these technologies and contributing to Metalsmith 
and its plugin ecosystem.

Check out my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/srcreigh) to see the

and some of my contributions to the Metalsmith community.
