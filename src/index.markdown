I am studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and I have a 
passion for making things. I have extensive mobile development 
experience on Android and iOS from an 8-month internship at 
[Relay](http://relay.im) and hackathon projects such as 
[Gestice](http://gestice.org).

## Blog
Nothing's there yet, though I plan to write about various things: Tricky steps
in learning new tech, perspectives I can provide on new tech, and any fun technical
challenges I've (perhaps not) overcome in my projects.

## Source
This website is built with a lot of cool new technology: 
[jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org), and in particular 
[Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io). One of the most exciting part of building 
this website was learning these technologies and contributing to Metalsmith 
and its plugin ecosystem.

Check out my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/srcreigh) to see the 
[source code for this website](http://github.com/srcreigh/srcreigh.github.io)
and some of my contributions to the Metalsmith community.
