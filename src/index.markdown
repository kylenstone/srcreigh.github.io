I study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and I have a passion for making things. I&rsquo;ve made things for an awesome startup called [Relay](http://relay.im). I also like making things like [Gestice](http://gestice.org) at hackathons.

## Resume & Email

[Here](/resume.pdf) is my resume. You can email me at: srcreigh @ my school&rsquo;s website.

## Interests

I'm currently interested in:
1. Changing the world with the Hackathon community,
2. Getting better at keeping my life organized via serving as Secretary of the
   Computer Science Club,
3. Writing about some really sick philosophy: language and knowledge, and
4. Organizing an intellectual, entrepreneurial discussion group on campus

## Sources of Pride

* The University of Waterloo's first 1000+ attendee hackathon, 
  [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com), was a huge success! I'm super
  happy to have managed the development of the native mobile apps for the event,
  as well as for volunteering all weekend and meeting tons of new people!
* [Relay](http://relay.im) managed to snag a nice pic of them sitting nicely
  above Yo and Telegram on the US Social Networking App Store charts in the
  middle of September!

This website is built with a lot of cool new technology: [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org), and in particular [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io). One of the most exciting part of building this website was learning these technologies and contributing to Metalsmith and its plugin ecosystem.
