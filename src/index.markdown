I study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and I have a passion for making things. I&rsquo;ve made things for an awesome startup called [Relay](http://relay.im). I also like making things like [Gestice](http://gestice.org) at hackathons. Speaking of hackathons, if you&rsquo;re an undergraduate or high school student, you should register for [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com)!

I'm currently interested in [helping incoming University of Waterloo frosh prepare for the coop program at waterloo](/blog/posts/preparing-for-uw-coop-part-one), building event apps for a sweet hackathon that&rsquo;s happening in Waterloo this September called [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com), and learning enough about algorithms to show a Silicon Valley corporate interviewer that I&rsquo;m awesome this September.

This website is built with a lot of cool new technology: [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org), and in particular [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io). One of the most exciting part of building this website was learning these technologies and contributing to Metalsmith and its plugin ecosystem.
